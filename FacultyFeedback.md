# Faculty Feedback #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).  Also look at Github Insights in your repository to see how active you are and how active others are.

## Week 8 ##
- Don't say someone else (say <person name> will be taking over screen sharing to the demo)
- You want transitions if you are switching speakers (not someone else, but person name)
- Why just college students? - wow you read my mind and answered this
- Know your presentation order and avoid screen shares switches
- Don't say I am going to do the demo, say "hello, I am <person name> and I am  going to demo the demo

## Week 9 ##
- Make sure update, remove or edit stories as needed to keep them up to date - this is called Backlog refinement

## Week 10 ##
- Board looks good - keep working on acceptance criterion
- Good move to React and Node
- Looking forward to the database decision
- Nice sprint lead work today
- Please be ready to demo - when you have working code demoing should not be a big deal
  
## Week 11 ##
- Keep on working on the different items you need to progress, uploading files, setting up database, using database
- Hopefully you'll progress to having something to demo next week
- Nice acceptance criterion

- Focus on coding work that shows the unique value of your product
- For the dry run week, I'll give you about an hour of time to organize yourselves via team work time and then we'll all come back to the main room and I'll pick teams to present in random order

## Week 14 ##
  - Like the name and logo, but once you are outside of IIT what are you going to call it?  Shouldn't you call it that now?
- You personas are actually scenarios (https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/personas)
- Too much text on slide above
- Demo scenario - why not use Julia instead of a user?
- Don't show the database - assume you are demoing from a user using your sites perspective 
- Demo what about a description of the item not just a title.
- Payments could be challenging
