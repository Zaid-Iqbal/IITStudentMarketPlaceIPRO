## **Top Two to Three Scenarios**

### **Your Scenario #1**

Juliette is an international student graduating at the end of the semester. She has a refrigerator that she bought for her dorm, but now does not know what to do with it. She can not take it back home, nor can she just throw it away. So she opens the HawkShop app and creates a posting for her refrigerator. A couple of students message her back inquiring and offering exchanges. She then negotiates the price and arranges the right exchange. They then agree on an exchange point within the safety of their campus.

### **Your Scenario #2**

Kenny is an undergraduate student who just finished his second year at IIT. He owns several textbooks from his classes which he no longer needs. He opens the HawkShop app and posts his textbooks. Students are able to search by course and find the textbooks they need. Kenny is able to connect with an incoming second year who is taking several of the same courses and they are able to negotiate a bundle deal. They then agree on an exchange point within the safety of their campus.

### **Your Scenario #3**

Marcus is an incoming freshman and is living on campus on his own for the first time. A week into the semester, he realizes that he needs a TI-84 calculator. He needs it for class but he can’t go to the school store because the price is too much for a brand new one. He opens the HawkShop and searches for ‘TI-84’ in the search box. The app gives him a couple search results of some of his peers selling their used TI-84 calculators for half the price of a new one at his university. He contacts the seller and they agree to sell the item. They both agree on a meeting place on campus and a time to meet in the app. The two meet and make the transaction.

## **What do we want to accomplish/learn together?**

- Team Building and teamwork

- Use of GitHub as a team

- Full Stack Web Development

- How to design an intuitive and user-friendly website

## **Tools**

- We will use GitHub for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.

- If we need to meet outside of class we have found a mutually agreeable time at: Discord

- If we need to meet outside of class we will use Discord to communicate.

- When we are not meeting together we will use Discord.

## **Requested Approach/Behavior**

- We will communicate respectfully in a professional manner. Discussions only. No arguing/name calling of any kind. Respect the ideas of each team member.

- We will divide work fairly. Each member will be responsible for the work they choose to be assigned to (based on their skillset). Each member should be assigned to one or more stories on the Kanban board.

## **Unacceptable behavior**

- We will not make large group decisions or submissions without the entire groups approval

- It is not acceptable to not complete the work you were assigned to without communicating any possible difficulties

## **How we will productively solve disagreement**

- We will use Github for version control. Team-members will push their finished code to a branch to ensure the main branch remains bug-free.

- We will talk it out and understand the perspective of our fellow team members.

- If we cannot figure it out, we will ask our professor to mediate or have a group vote
